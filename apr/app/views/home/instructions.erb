    <h1>Instructions</h1>


    <p>The unit should prepare an initial action plan based upon the entire APR process. The unit’s action plan should
      reflect both short-term and long-term action items that are aligned with the goals and mission of the unit,
      college/school, and university. The action items should be feasible with respect to the program/department/unit,
      college, and university resources; sustainable; and measurable. The action plan should address any shortcomings
      noted
      by the APR review team with respect to the APR Criterion, be reflective of any goals of the program based upon
      the
      unit’s mission and strategic planning initiatives, and take into account the review team’s recommendations or
      comments, where appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>The initial action plan or the annual update to the action plan should be arranged according to UNM’s current
      Academic Program Review Criteria (see attached document or refer to the APR Policy Manual found at apr.unm.edu).
      Comments or a brief narrative explaining the action items or updates should be included at the end of each
      Criterion
      section.
    </p>

    <p>Each action item should include:</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>A description of the action item and associated tasks written in measurable terms with appropriate
        measurable
        outcome(s)/metrics.
      </li>
      <li>The person(s) responsible for this action</li>
      <li>Resources needed for completing the action item (if there are budgetary requirements, please indicate the
        amount,
        funding source, and approvals for the funding source).
        <strong><i>If an action item requires significant external resources, a plan for how those resources will be
          obtained must be provided.</i></strong>
      </li>

      <li>A timeline for implementation with the projected start date and target date for completion.</li>

      <li>The current status of the item or task</li>
    </ol>
